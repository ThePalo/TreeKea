# TreeKea
This is the practice of PRO2, an UPC subject (of the first year of the degree) about programming.
The statement of practice is able in the pdf file: statment.pdf.
To compile you can use the makefile file. Using the command "make", it will compile and then, you will be able to execute the program.exe.
Also, you can get the documentation files using Doxyfile. This file is inside the repository, so you only have to install the program Doxygen and, then, write the command "doxygen". After this, you will have all the documentation well structured in a html folder and pdf folder.
This practice is made in order to review the modular programming, tree structures and clases.
As it's a first year work, it can have some errors: for example, the most important mistake is that there is one function which returns a complex data structure and it doesn't follow the modular structure.
