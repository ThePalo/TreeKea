The statement of practice is able in the pdf file.
To compile you can use the makefile file. Using the command "make", it will compile and then, you will 
be able to execute the program.exe.
Also, you can get the documentation files using Doxyfile. This file is inside the repository, so you only have to install
the program Doxygen and, then, write the command "doxygen". After this, you will have all the documentation well structured in
a html folder and pdf folder.
